Study presented in this paper tries to combine few selected classifiers in such way that will empower them to gain rejection capabilities. The main goal is to come up with a model which structure allows to reject patterns that are outside of native elements classes' scope without any prior knowledge about such patterns. Those outliers, denoted as foreign elements, are very common in real life situations when dealing with noisy, erroneous or unknown measurements. The main drawback of commonly used classifiers is their requirement to always classify provided pattern to one of the classes their were trained on, which forces inclusion of foreign elements within training sets. Although not impossible, this approach is quite impractical as most of the time there are just too many possible cases of foreign elements. This paper tries to find solution to this presented problem.

The document is structured as follows: the first chapter introduces reader to the commonly used, well-known classifiers, describing their structures and briefly explaining the way they work. The next chapter covers quality measurements which help in evaluating proposed solutions and their results. Next, the datasets used during testing process are described. The following chapters present proposed classifier structures with rejection option, explaining the main ideas behind them and comparing their results achieved on provided data.
