\chapter{Classifiers with rejection option}
\label{classifiers_with_rejection_option}

This chapter describes various structures that, while using classifiers, have rejection capabilities. Each structure is described in details, has information about the main idea behind its logic and implementation. Classifiers presented in this chapter have been proposed and implemented solely by the author with some theoretical help from the supervisor. Some of the ideas for classifiers' structures were based on two previous author's publications (\cite{PiotrWaszkiewicz1} and \cite{PiotrWaszkiewicz2}), although newer approaches were introduced resulting in completely new results.
